# Magical Characters: Harry Potter Card UI

This project is a visually engaging web application that showcases characters from the Harry Potter universe. It features a modern, interactive card-based user interface, allowing users to explore, search, and filter through magical characters and their key details. The app is styled to reflect the magical theme of Harry Potter, including the use of the iconic "Harry Potter" font.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5 & CSS3**: For structure and responsive, modern styling.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For interactivity, data fetching, and filtering logic.
- **Harry Potter API**: Dynamic character data is fetched live from [HP-API](https://hp-api.onrender.com/api/characters).
- **Custom Fonts**: "Harry Potter" font for titles and branding.

## Reflections

### 1. What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far?

I learned a lot about how to use JavaScript to fetch data from an API and dynamically display it on a webpage. Working with real data from the Harry Potter API made the project more interesting and helped me understand how to handle JSON and update the DOM.

I also realized the importance of organizing code for readability, especially when adding features like search and filters. One question I still have is how to make the UI even more interactive or how to improve performance when working with a larger set of data.

### 2. How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And how long did you expect it to take?

It took me about **3 to 4 hours** to complete the assignment. I expected it to take around **2 hours**, but I spent extra time figuring out how to style the cards nicely and how to properly use custom fonts. Debugging some small issues also took longer than I anticipated, but I learned a lot in the process.
